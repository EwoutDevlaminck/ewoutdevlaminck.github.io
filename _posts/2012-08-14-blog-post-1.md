This blogpost attempts to give a comprehensive introduction to the work described mainly in the following three papers:
‘Discovering Governing Equations from Data by Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems’ [1]
‘Data-Driven Discovery of Coordinates and Governing Equations’ [2]
‘Data-Driven Discovery of Partial Differential Equations’. [3]
The work on SINDy and related projects is still very much ongoing and each year numerous breakthroughs are made. Here I just try to highlight the concept, as well as some of the initial successes that have been achieved.


Discovering governing equations – The need for SINDy
======
 > “Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.” ---<cite>Werner Heisenberg.</cite>


One of the main goals of science, is to describe the world in terms of theories and formulas. To discover models that capture the essence of vastly complex systems and give us the power to predict what will happen next, or how we can change it. In our pursuit for these models, the problems we tried to tackle have become increasingly harder. With the realisation that solving systems analytically is becoming more and more unfeasible, science has made a drastic migration to the computational domain ever since its power became available. 
For many of the hot topics in science today- climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance epidemiology, etc.- data is abundant, but good models remain elusive. As the quote by Heisenberg suggests, maybe some of these systems surpass what we as humans are capable of grasping. Maybe, we need to rely on machines to help us discover models and dynamics. And what better tool to use, than machine learning?

Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics, or SINDy for short, tries to do exactly this. It builds on the observation that many natural systems governed by equations containing only a few terms (in an appropriate basis, that is) and tries to implement this. SINDy applies a combination of sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning to nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. 
In the following, I will try to walk you through the working principles of SINDy on the basis of some of the problems they were able to solve.


Example- The Lorenz system
======
As a first example consider the Lorenz system ([Lorenz system wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)). It was first introduced in the 1963 by Edward Lorenz, Ellen Fetter and Margaret Hamilton as a simplified model for atmospheric convection. Even though it is quite simple in structure, it was one of the first systems that popularized chaos theory, as the system becomes chaotic under some initial conditions.

SINDy is used to try and recover the system of coupled equations, based solely on a time history of the ‘state **x**(t)’ (here x,y,z). The input to the model consists of this state and its time derivative (either given or computed numerically). With this input, a library $\Theta$(**X**) is constructed, consisting of all the candidate nonlinear terms built from **X** we want to include. Each one of these terms can then show up in the resulting equations. With P<sub>n</sub> denoting polynomial terms of order n, a library may look like this:

The sparse regression problem that is subsequantly solved, is simply stated as 

![Lorenz](/images/Picture14.png)
 
We try to find the sparse vectors of coefficients given by $\Xi$. This is a sparse matrix, with the nonzero elements indicating what terms from the candidate library should be present in the system of equations. Essentially, for every coordinate of the original problem a regression has to be solved in this manner. This already highlights one of the major limitations of this model, as a solution quickly becomes unfeasible as the number of coordinates grows.

The model for the Lorenz system is shown schematically above. The function library contains mixed polynomial terms up to order 5 and the $\Xi$ matrix is clearly very sparse, with only a couple of nonzero coefficients. Even though the input data is noisy (mainly caused by the numerical errors introduced in taking the time derivative), the true model is retrieved exceptionally well, with all the correct terms being identified, as well as the magnitudes of the coefficients.
