This blogpost attempts to give a comprehensive introduction to the work described mainly in the following three papers:
‘Discovering Governing Equations from Data by Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems’ [1]
‘Data-Driven Discovery of Coordinates and Governing Equations’ [2]
‘Data-Driven Discovery of Partial Differential Equations’. [3]
The work on SINDy and related projects is still very much ongoing and each year numerous breakthroughs are made. Here I just try to highlight the concept, as well as some of the initial successes that have been achieved.
